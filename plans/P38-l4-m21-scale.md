## Goal

Author every lesson of Scale (`m21-scale`), the 4-lesson next module of Master (l4-master), in English: this closing L4 module addresses the scale problems a reader only meets after everything else in the course: codebases too big for one context window, and enterprise gateway deployment options. Each lesson follows the fixed template (D006): Objectives + prerequisites, When NOT to use, Concept, Hands-on lab, Anti-patterns, Quiz, Sources. Every command shown was actually run against the lab repo and every claim is backed by real output (D093) — this plan produces no lesson content from memory alone.

## Context

Read first: `docs/CURRICULUM.md` (P03) — it is the **authoritative** source for this module's final lesson slugs, objectives, and order; the lesson list below is the floor the approved plan set, not a ceiling. Also read `research/feature-inventory.md` and `research/deprecations.md` (P03) for what is current vs. "Changed" as of `verified_version: 2.1.263`; `content/_shared/sources.json` (P23) for the vetted source list to pull from and append to; `.claude/rules/content.md`, `.claude/skills/new-lesson/SKILL.md` and the `lesson-researcher`/`lesson-writer`/`fact-checker`/`reviewer` agents (all P11) for the exact authoring workflow; `content/schema.ts` (P06) for the frontmatter zod schema; `docs/design/CANVAS.md` and `/design/` (P05) for the lesson-page visual reference; and the outline text this module was scoped from:

> `m21-scale`: large codebases · context engineering · prompt caching · gateways/Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry overview

No lesson in this module exists yet; `content/en/l4-master/m21-scale/**` starts from the level/module `index.mdx` stub P06 created.

Decisions this module leans on beyond the shared pipeline decisions below: .

## Scope

In:
- 4 lesson files under `content/en/l4-master/m21-scale/`, numbered `01-`…`04-`, each a complete MDX file following D006's seven sections.
- The matching Turkish draft stub for each lesson under `content/tr/l4-master/m21-scale/` (`draft: true`, created by the `/new-lesson` skill in the same commit as the EN lesson — D016, D018; P25/P26/P40/P41 translate it later, never this plan).
- One raw lab transcript per lesson with a hands-on lab, saved under `content/_shared/transcripts/m21-scale/`, plus the simplified `<Transcript>` rendering embedded in the lesson (D099).
- This module's entries appended to `content/_shared/sources.json` (D041, D043; append-only — never rewrite another module's entries).
- Updating `l4-master/index.mdx` and `m21-scale/index.mdx` module-index copy if this module's final lesson list differs from the stub P06 left (rare; only if `docs/CURRICULUM.md` changed the outline).

Out: Turkish translation of these lessons (P25/P26/P40/P41 own `content/tr/l4-master/m21-scale/**` after this plan hands it off); any other module's content; MDX component code (P07/P08 own those; if a lesson needs a component that does not exist, write it into `open_questions` and do not build it here); changes to `content/schema.ts`, `src/lib/nav.ts`, or any route/layout file; the lab repo itself (P22 owns `codechup/claude-code-lab`; this plan clones and runs it, never edits it in place — a bug fix needed there goes into `open_questions` naming the tag).

## Deliverables

- `content/en/l4-master/m21-scale/NN-<slug>.mdx` (4 files):
01. **Working in large codebases** — `01-large-codebases.mdx`
02. **Context engineering** — `02-context-engineering.mdx`
03. **Prompt caching** — `03-prompt-caching.mdx`
04. **Gateways: Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry overview** — `04-gateways-bedrock-vertex-foundry-overview.mdx`
- `content/tr/l4-master/m21-scale/NN-<slug>.mdx` (4 files) — `draft: true` stubs with EN frontmatter fields carried over and `title`/`description` left in English (translation is not this plan's job; the stub exists so routing/parity gates pass).
- `content/_shared/transcripts/m21-scale/NN-<slug>.md` — one per lesson that has a hands-on lab, containing the raw terminal transcript.
- Updated `content/_shared/sources.json` with this module's sources block entries.

## Acceptance criteria

- `node scripts/content-gate.ts` passes for this module: every lesson's frontmatter validates against `content/schema.ts`, every code fence has a language tag, EN/TR path parity holds (the TR draft exists at the same slug), and `level`/`module` in frontmatter match the file path.
- Every lesson has `verified_version: 2.1.263` and a non-empty `sources` array with at least one `type: "doc"` entry whose URL was fetched successfully by `/verify-sources` (D041, D043) — paste the WebFetch/lychee evidence in the PR.
- Every lesson with a hands-on lab has a transcript file under `content/_shared/transcripts/m21-scale/` whose content matches, verbatim, a real run of the commands shown in the lesson (D093, D099) — no lesson may show output that was not captured this way.
- `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` pass; `npm run build` succeeds and `dist/en/l4-master/m21-scale/` contains 4 lesson pages plus the index.
- `npx playwright test e2e/lesson.spec.ts` passes against at least one lesson in this module (axe: 0 serious/critical violations at 390 px and 1280 px).
- The `fact-checker` agent's report (pasted into the PR) shows no unresolved discrepancy against `research/feature-inventory.md`; the `reviewer` agent's report confirms the D006 template order and the evidence rule on every lesson.

## Steps

1. Read `docs/CURRICULUM.md` §m21-scale and confirm the lesson list/order below still matches; if it drifted, follow the doc, not this plan, and note the delta in Handoff notes.
2. Run the `lesson-researcher` agent once per lesson (D098): official doc URL(s) + 2–3 web/YouTube sources, summarized against `research/feature-inventory.md`; save nothing permanent yet, this feeds step 4.
3. Clone `codechup/claude-code-lab` (P22) into a scratch directory; for every lesson with a hands-on lab, check out its start tag (`lesson/m21-scale-NN-start`), do the exercise for real, and capture the full terminal transcript.
4. Write each lesson MDX with `/new-lesson l4-master/m21-scale/<slug>` (creates the EN file and the TR draft stub together); fill Objectives, When NOT to use, Concept (grounded in the researcher's summary, never invented), Hands-on lab (the exact commands from step 3), Anti-patterns, Quiz, Sources.
5. Save the raw transcript from step 3 under `content/_shared/transcripts/m21-scale/NN-<slug>.md`; embed the simplified version with the `<Transcript>` component (P07) in the lesson.
6. Append this lesson's sources to `content/_shared/sources.json` (P23's schema); run `/verify-sources content/en/l4-master/m21-scale/NN-<slug>.mdx` to stamp `verified_at`.
7. Run the `fact-checker` agent against the whole module, then the `reviewer` agent (read-only; template + evidence + sources); fix everything both flag.
8. `node scripts/content-gate.ts && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`; run `npx playwright test e2e/lesson.spec.ts` against one lesson from this module.
9. Open the PR with the fact-checker and reviewer reports plus real command output pasted in (D093); never paste output you did not just produce.

## Tests required

- `scripts/content-gate.ts` (schema, fences, EN/TR parity, level/module-vs-path).
- `npm test` (Vitest — `src/lib` nav/slug helpers exercised against this module's new slugs).
- `e2e/lesson.spec.ts` (Playwright + axe) against one lesson in this module, both 390 px and 1280 px.
- Manual: every command in every "Hands-on lab" section was run against the cloned lab repo this session and matches its saved transcript.

## Non-goals / pitfalls

- Do not write Turkish lesson prose in this plan — the draft stub exists only so the build does not break; leave its body as the EN-derived placeholder `/new-lesson` generates.
- Do not fabricate command output, ever — if a lab command's real result differs from what the lesson expects, fix the lesson (or flag the lab repo bug in `open_questions`), never the transcript.
- Do not invent a component that does not exist (Quiz, DecisionTree, Transcript, Sources, OSTabs, WhenNotToUse, Lab, Callout, CodeBlock, YouTubeCard are the only ones available, from P07/P08) — write the gap into `open_questions` instead.
- Do not touch another module's files, `content/schema.ts`, or anything under `src/**`.
- Do not mark a lesson's Turkish stub `draft: false` — that flip belongs to the translation plan.

## Verification

A reviewer opens `npm run dev`, visits each of the 4 lessons at `/en/l4-master/m21-scale/<slug>/`, confirms the OS tabs, transcript, quiz, and sources block render, spot-checks two Sources links by hand, and reads the fact-checker/reviewer agent reports pasted in the PR before merging.
